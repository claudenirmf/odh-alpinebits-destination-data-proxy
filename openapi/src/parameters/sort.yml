  description: Requests for retrieved resources to be sorted by the value some
    selected field. Sorting requests may be in ascending (e.g.,
    `sort=startDate`) or descending order (e.g., `sort=-startDate`) by prefixing
    the field name with a MINUS (U+002D) character. Sorted requests may also
    take multiple fields as input as well as nested fields (e).g.,
    `sort=-startDate,name.eng`). If a request includes both `random` and `sort`
    requests, the server shall respond with `400 Bad Request`. If a server is
    unable to use any selected fields to sort resources, it shall respond with
    `400 Bad Request`.
